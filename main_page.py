    #### Monte Carlo simulation results on the FRAC method of Salani&eacute;-Wolak 2022.
    
    This app shows detailed results of the simulations reported in sections 6 and 7 of the paper:

    1. the distribution of the FRAC and MPEC estimates for a reasonably realistic 'macro-BLP'  model
    2. as well as specification tests
    3. and  variance decompositions of market shares and costs
    4. and the asymptotic properties of FRAC in the many-market limit.
